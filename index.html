  <!-- This is the list under the about me tab -->
  <ol>
  <li>I am relatively new to web development but over the short few weeks i've been learning it, it has been so much fun, it's honestly so gratifying to type all the code and watch it actually work and appear the way i wanted it to.</li>
  <li>Throughout the entire process of joining the program and working on the modules i've made a few friends along the way and we have started working together on our own side projects.</li>
  </ol>
